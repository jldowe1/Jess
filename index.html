<p id="description">The Helix aspersa is an air-breathing snail, which has a single lung. They have a brownish soft body, covered with slimy mucus and yellow or cream-colored shells with brown spiral stripes. The shell of this species has a height of about 0-9-1.3 Inches, and a width of 0.9-1.5 inches and a lip appears at its edge when an individual is old. It is a small mollusk, with a shell that has a sphere shape and a slightly rough surface, with about 4 or 5 spirals. Not all individuals have the shell of the same color; some have it dark brown, but the majority has it light brown or with a golden hue; also, it shows several brown or yellow stripes. This shell has a large opening whose edges are white. </p>         

 
<h2 id="taxonomy">TAXONOMY</h2> 
 <p class= "tax"> The gastropods, more commonly known as snails and slugs, belong to a large taxonomic class of invertebrates within the phylum Mollusca, called Gastropoda. The class Gastropoda contains a vast total of named species, second only to the insects in overall number. The fossil history of this class goes back to the Late Cambrian. As of 2017, 721 families of gastropods are known, of which 245 are extinct and appear only in the fossil record, while 476 are currently extant with or without a fossil record. Gastropoda are a major part of the phylum Mollusca, and are the most highly diversified class in the phylum, with 65,000 to 80,000 living snail and slug species. The anatomy, behavior, feeding, and reproductive adaptations of gastropods vary significantly from one clade or group to another. Therefore, it is difficult to state many generalities for all gastropods. Although the name “snail” can be, and often is, applied to all the members of this class, commonly this word means only those species with an external shell big enough that the soft parts can withdraw completely into it. Those gastropods without a shell, and those with only a very reduced or internal shell, are usually known as slugs; those with a shell into which they can partly but not completely withdraw are termed semi-slugs. </p>

<h2 id="bio">BIOLOGY</h2>
 <p>Land snails move by gliding along on their muscular foot, which is lubricated with mucus and covered with epithelial cilia. This motion is powered by succeeding waves of muscular contractions that move down the ventral of the foot. This muscular action is clearly visible when a snail is crawling on the glass of a window or aquarium. Snails move at a proverbially low speed. Snails secrete mucus externally to keep their soft bodies from drying out. They also secrete mucus from the foot to aid in locomotion by reducing friction, and to help reduce the risk of mechanical injury from sharp objects, meaning they can crawl over a sharp edge like a straight razor and not be injured. The mucus that land snails secrete with the foot leaves a slime trail behind them, which is often visible for some hours afterwards as a shiny “path” on the surface over which they have crawled. Land snails range greatly in size. Most molluscs, including land snails, have a shell which is part of their anatomy since the larval stage, and which grows with them in size by the process of secreting calcium carbonate along the open edge and on the inner side for extra strength.</p>

<h2 id="ecology">ECOLOGY</h2>
<p> Land snails are mollusks found on all continents and they occur virtually everywhere in Eastern North America, where there are more than 500 native species. They live primarily in the upper leaf litter of forests, old fields, and wetlands, but also in more disturbed habitats such as active gardens and fields, river banks, suburbs, and even cities. They eat very low on the food web, as most land snails will consume rotting vegetation like moist leaf litter, and also fungi and sometimes eat soil directly. The land snail relies on a diet rich in calcium and other nutrients to support the growth and repair of its shell as well as its overall health. </p>

<h2 id="behavior">BEHAVIOR</h2>
<p> This mollusk has a soft body protected by the shell, but when it is not feeding or when it feels danger, it retracts to its shell. The garden snail is a terrestrial species with nocturnal habits; it does most of its day-to-day activities at night or very early in the morning, but if it rains during the day, it usually goes out. In hot or drought periods, Helix aspersa retracts in its shell and covers the opening with a layer of mucus called epiphragm, which helps to keep the moisture inside and avoid the attack of animals that can kill it, like some ants. After doing this, it enters a state of inactivity that compares to hibernation. But not all snails hibernate. For example, in Southern California, young individuals are often active throughout the year.
Some of these snails hibernate during winter months, especially when they are mature, but they return to activity with the spring. </p>

<h3> SNAIL SEX </h3>
<p> The first thing you should know about these terrestrial gastropod mollusks is that most are hermaphrodites. Hermaphrodite is called any organism that has male and female reproductive organs and therefore can produce both eggs and spermatozoa. It is like if the snails were male and female at the same time. When a snail is already mature can begin mating, that is clear, but how do they approximate each other? <br> <br> 

Before the intercourse, both approach to start the courtship process consisting of a series of movements and attitudes that will finish or not in the mating. The entire process can last as little as 2 hours or as long as 12 hours. To find a partner, they primarily rely on their sense of smell and touch, as their visual capacity is poorly developed and devoid of hearing. They can recognize chemicals in the air that communicate the receptivity of some other snail nearby.
<br> <br> 
During the process, both land snails get closer, acknowledging each other and “testing the odds.” As they approach, they begin to interact in a more physical way and can touch each other with the help of their tentacles. Some move in circles and can bite the area of the genital pore. In the final stage of courtship and before mating, some species use a unique weapon: the “love darts.” No, it is not a metaphor, it is a structure of calcium or chitin that only sexually mature snails have, and usually that have mated more than once. Seen in detail, they indeed resemble pointed darts. The function of love darts is not transferring sperm but is a form of sexual selection, and observations concluded that garden snails (Helix aspersa) could increase their reproductive success. The mucus that covers a dart contains a type of hormones capable of increasing the chances of success to have offspring. </p>

<h2 id="relationship">RELATIONSHIP WITH HUMANS</h2>
<p> This species is edible, and it is sometimes used for cooking, although it should not be confused with the helix pomatia, the “Escargot.” Although it is considered a pest in most places, it has acquired popularity in the cosmetic industry because of the regenerative properties of their mucus.</p>
